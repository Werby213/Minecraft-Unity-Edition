# Minecraft in  unity
made by me


## TODO:

- add a rainfall noise map to the world just like the temperature map (https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Biome?file=Biome_Index.PNG)
- maybe make use of compute shaders to generate the world faster

- add 3d noise to the world

- fix noise never going above 0.67

- also change the inventory on the server instead of only on the client (so that the server can save the inventory)
